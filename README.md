# Polestar API

[![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-orange)](https://github.com/)  
A modern **ASP.NET 9.0** application built with **C#**, designed to provide a simplified and 
accessible wrapper around the **unofficial Polestar API**. This project is currently a 
**work in progress** and aims to make integration with Polestar's systems easier for developers.


## üöÄ Features

- **ASP.NET Core 9.0**: Built with the latest version of .NET for high performance and scalability.
- **Scalar Integration**: Provides interactive API documentation using Scalar.
- **RESTful Architecture**: Designed to follow REST principles for clean and maintainable endpoints.
- **Authentication Module**: Includes an initial implementation of user authentication with 
  token-based responses.
- **API Versioning**: Supports multiple API versions for backward compatibility.
- **CORS Support**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests for flexible client integration.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation**: Automatically generates OpenAPI specifications for better 
  developer experience.


## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture to ensure modularity and maintainability:

```
PolestarApi/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Contracts/          # Interfaces and shared models (e.g., AuthRequest, AuthResponse)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication/     # Authentication logic (e.g., AuthService)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controllers/        # API controllers (e.g., AuthController)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App/                # Application configuration (e.g., Startup.cs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
